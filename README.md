# nomogram_IDHmut_glioma

Gliomas, the most common primary brain tumors, present significant challenges due to their diverse prognoses and treatment complexities. Recent advances in molecular biology have identified the isocitrate dehydrogenase (IDH) mutation as a key marker in glioma classification. While IDH-mutant gliomas generally have better outcomes than their wildtype counterparts, substantial survival variations persist within this group, highlighting the need for further investigation into prognostic factors. We analyzed factors influencing the OS of IDH-mutant gliomas using real-world data and developed a clinical prognostic calculator.
